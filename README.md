# KitCast 

#### A simple project based on Simon Kusterer's [castnow](https://github.com/xat/castnow) and  Petr Kotek's  [chromecastize](https://github.com/petrkotek/chromecastize)
KitCast basically unifies both projects, it does convert and cast the video, there's a lot of tests to do and a lot of stuff to improve on it.

## To Install: 
    chmod +x ./install.sh 
    ./install.sh
    
## To run: 
    kitcast -f video_name.extension 


## Flags: 
* -f --file filemane (the name of the video you want to watch) 

* -s --subtitle subtitle.srt 

* -d --device chromecast_name (if you have multiple chromecasts then this might be useful)
