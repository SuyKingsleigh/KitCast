1
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:06,051
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,300
_

3
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,161
Thief!

4
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:20,320
- Let me back in.
- How did you get out there?

5
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,160
- Seeing a friend.
- I'll chop your hand off!

6
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,960
I say friend. We're not that
close. Please, let me back in.

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,881
Please, let me back in. Fast.

8
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,680
You can't keep stealing
from merchants in the souk.

9
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,520
They know where you're from.

10
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:41,840
You tell me creating happiness is
important to my mental wellbeing.

11
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,840
Game like this makes me happy.

12
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:48,480
Time to go back in your
room. It'll be dark soon.

13
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,880
Have you taken precautions?
Have you told everyone?

14
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,280
Tahira...

15
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:54,280
We have to keep everyone safe.

16
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:56,680
- Nothing is going to happen, Tahira.
- Of course it is.

17
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,681
I told you to tell them. I told
the doctors, I told all of you.

18
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,320
They're real.

19
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,761
I understand they seem real to you.

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,640
You need to rest. Sleep will help.

21
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:11,521
Sleep is when they'll come.

22
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,121
I can feel them coming.

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,121
They'll be here tonight.

24
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:20,801
Rest well, Tahira.

25
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,121
Maryam! Maryam!

26
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:42,960
Over here.

27
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,720
- I told you to lock the doors.
- We don't do that.

28
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,801
Get everyone out.

29
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:54,160
Oh, no.

30
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,320
I tried to warn you.

31
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,840
Don't struggle.

32
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:04,760
They like it more when you struggle.

34
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,400
- Here we are! Sheffield.
- Is it the right day?

35
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:21,120
- It's the right day.
- In the right year?

36
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,600
The day you asked, in
the year that you asked,

37
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,560
at the time that you
asked... you are home.

38
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:28,160
Ah. Everyone meet back here?

39
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,600
Tomorrow lunchtime?

40
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,440
Yeah, yeah. What you gonna do?

41
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:33,400
Me? Oh, you know...

42
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:35,400
Very busy.

43
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:37,760
Busy, busy. I've got maintenance.

44
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,480
Correspondence.

45
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:41,841
Correspondence about maintenance.

46
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,800
Oh, okay, not the exact right time,

47
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,800
77 minutes out. Late.

48
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,881
What?!

49
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,960
You sure you're gonna
be alright on your own?

50
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,440
Ah, you know... finally
a bit of peace and quiet.

51
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,481
Hmm.

52
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,200
I could always...

53
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,081
Oh, nah.

54
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,401
Maybe I'll just nip straight
to tomorrow lunchtime.

55
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,561
What was that?

56
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:29,480
Location for that noise.

57
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:30,961
Aleppo?

58
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,161
I've got time.

59
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,560
Sorry, sorry.

60
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,240
Am I late? It is the
right day, isn't it?

61
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,080
Have you been waiting
long? Am I really late?

62
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,040
Yes, yes, yes and yes.

63
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,000
Mum and Dad left hours ago.

64
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,880
Whitby for the night.

65
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:52,481
Did you cook?

66
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:55,281
Can you cook now?

67
00:04:57,441 --> 00:04:59,081
Hi, loser.

68
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,441
Hey, no-mark.

69
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,400
What you doing here, man?

70
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,160
I got your messages, didn't I?

71
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:18,360
- It's been months.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,841
Me phone's been playing up.

73
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:24,640
- So... so are you back?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,040
Sort of.

75
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,840
Not really. Just a few hours.

76
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:30,081
I bought chips. You
gonna let me in or what?

77
00:05:31,161 --> 00:05:32,641
It's not a good time.

78
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,760
I got chips, though!

79
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,041
Come on.

80
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:54,960
And that, gentlemen, is a full... house.

81
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,040
What?

82
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,120
Well, I've been practising,
ain't I? On me travels. Hey?

83
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,680
Gotta say, it's great to see you lads.

84
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,480
Don't sound like I've
been missing much, though.

85
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:05,480
Nothing at all. I'd rather
be on cruises, like you.

86
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,040
Let me tell you, Gabe, those boats,
mate, they are lovely. Very calm.

87
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,880
And how's your health now, Gra? Alright?

88
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,680
Good, Freddy boy, thanks. Very good.

89
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,760
How you coping?

90
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:16,360
Without Grace?

91
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:18,840
Well, I have to, don't I? You know?

92
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:21,080
Travelling helps, mate, don't it?

93
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,360
Stops me getting stuck in the past.

94
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:35,320
Aleppo.

95
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,840
1380. Welcome to Syria.

96
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:39,881
Now... Oh...

97
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,881
They're not here, are they?

98
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,681
"Bimaristan".

99
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,560
That means 'sick place'.

100
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:52,480
This must be one of the
oldest hospitals in the world.

101
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:55,680
Of course, Islamic physicians
are known for the enlightened way

102
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,801
they treated people with
mental health problems.

103
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,320
What happened here?

104
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,720
You guys go this way... oh!

105
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,120
Who am I supposed to share all
the interesting stuff with?!

106
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:09,360
Is someone there?

107
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:11,681
Friendly visitors... visitor.

108
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,361
Where are you? I'm coming to say hello.

109
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,001
I'm the Doctor.

110
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,601
I'm here to help!

111
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,520
- Stay away!
- It's alright.

112
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:31,560
- You're safe, I promise.
- No, they took everyone.

113
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:34,440
- What happened here?
- You have to get out!

114
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,680
Why?

115
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,920
Because there's one still here.

116
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:55,000
What are you?

117
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,040
Leave her alone!

118
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,721
Stay here!

119
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,080
Gone. That was fast.

120
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,241
Nothing.

121
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:12,281
Nothing at all.

122
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,960
Right, lads, ready? Here we go.

123
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:20,000
Fastest dealer in South Yorkshire.

124
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,121
Can you see?

125
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:39,881
Can you see it?

126
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,161
I'm trapped.

127
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,001
This is what he did to me.

128
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,080
Help me, Graham.

129
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,561
He's close.

130
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,680
I think you lost count.

131
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,801
Huh?

132
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,040
Goes past one.

133
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,561
Goes past two.

134
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,240
It's a screamer!

135
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,920
Top bins! Final seconds.

136
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:11,800
He's got it. He's a legend.

137
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,680
Ryan Sinclair, FIFA legend.

138
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,441
I've never lost it.
Oh! I've still got it.

139
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:21,561
I'll make tea.

140
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,800
The place is normally
spotless. This ain't you.

141
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,920
Mate, you ain't been around,
so don't tell me what I am.

142
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:37,241
Alright.

143
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,881
Mate, sorry for not
answering your messages...

144
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:48,721
... but you ain't yourself.

145
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm just... finding things
difficult at the moment.

146
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,501
- Have you spoken to anyone about it?
- No! And I'm not going to.

147
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,601
Alright.

148
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,081
There's something else.

149
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:08,181
- Promise you won't laugh at me.
- I can't promise that, can I?

150
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:18,081
Last few days...

151
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,001
... I've been having nightmares.

152
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:23,881
Dark, messed-up stuff.

153
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:28,041
And there's this... bloke in them.

154
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:33,080
He keeps recurring, like
he's... watching my dreams.

155
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:34,760
Waiting in the dark.

156
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,481
- Ah, that's creepy.
- That's not the mad bit.

157
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,601
For the past few days...

158
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,121
... I've seen him.

159
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,281
At night, outside the
flat, across the hall...

160
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:52,280
... in my room.

161
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:54,480
The guy that's in your
dreams is in your room?

162
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:55,840
I knew you'd laugh.

163
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,440
Look at me.

164
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:59,041
I'm not laughing.

165
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:03,760
Mate, I've seen some weird
things while I've been away.

166
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:05,961
Things you wouldn't
believe were possible.

167
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,641
Would you kip here tonight?

168
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:16,280
So, can you say where you've
been... where they sent you?

169
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:19,320
Madagascar, California, Hong Kong.

170
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:22,120
- Gloucester.
- Oh, they had a thing in Gloucester.

171
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:25,400
Dad was going on about it.
Something to do with Russians.

172
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,721
Had nought to do with Russians.

173
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:31,201
- How's the new job?
- Sacked.

174
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,600
- Sonya!
- What?

175
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:34,880
That's the third time!

176
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:37,720
People are really annoying
and they hate being told that.

177
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm just not cut out
for customer services.

178
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:41,161
No kidding.

179
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,681
Sonya...

180
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,520
... we can stop doing this,

181
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,520
stop marking it.

182
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,721
I thought it was a good thing.

183
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,200
Yeah.

184
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:01,160
No, I just don't know whether
an anniversary dinner...

185
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:02,721
I still think about it.

186
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,201
Do you?

187
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:11,281
I dream about it sometimes.

188
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,760
Sofa movie after?

189
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:19,400
What? So you can fall
asleep halfway through?

190
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:21,400
I do not do that.

191
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:28,801
Idiot.

192
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:32,240
Hi.

193
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:34,600
I-I didn't know who to call.

194
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,441
We need help.

195
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:19,521
Who are you? What you doing here?

196
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,601
What you doing? Hey?!

197
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,120
Tibo!

198
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:27,240
- What is your name?
- Tahira.

199
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,640
Have you seen those
creatures before, Tahira?

200
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:31,160
Not really.

201
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,600
Who are you?

202
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:34,560
I've never seen you here before, Doctor.

203
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,761
Oh, my brief is quite wide-ranging.

204
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,760
No signs of those creatures
outside the bimaristan.

205
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:44,960
So, deliberately targeting a
hospital of vulnerable people.

206
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:47,080
The place is silent.
Where is everyone else?

207
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:50,200
- How many people were here?
- Maybe 10 or 12 patients.

208
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:52,040
I'm really sorry...

209
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,400
... but I think those creatures
must have taken them.

210
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:56,600
- Taken them where?
- I have no idea.

211
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,881
And... why have they left you behind?

212
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:01,242
How long have you been here?

213
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:04,200
If it's not a personal
question, which it is.

214
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:05,721
A few weeks.

215
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,320
I've travelled a long way.

216
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,121
Seen a lot of things I wish I hadn't.

217
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:14,600
My family were killed when I were seven.

218
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,080
I ran.

219
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,120
Aleppo was safety for me,

220
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,240
they let me in here
because I wasn't doing well.

221
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:22,280
I promise to keep you
safe. We will work this out.

222
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:25,000
Ah! Really sorry.

223
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:27,840
Message device. Someone's
trying to get in touch.

224
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:31,640
Just in 14th century Syria. Is
it lunchtime tomorrow already?!

225
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,760
I need your help.

226
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:34,400
- Me mate's been taken.
- What?

227
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,320
Wait! Another call.

228
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,720
- Yaz?
- Doctor.

229
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:39,280
There was a figure in our flat.

230
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:40,920
Oh, hold on.

231
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:42,800
Ah. Graham?

232
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:45,640
Hey, Doc, I keep seeing
these images of planets,

233
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,400
like they're being
projected into my head.

234
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:50,880
Hmm. Hold on. Call merge.

235
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm coming to get you all now.

236
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:54,080
And I'm bringing my new friend, Tahira.

237
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,440
- Who?
- I'll be there in a sec.

238
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:57,961
Oh!

239
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,320
It did leave something behind.

240
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:06,080
I knew it. This'll tell us something.

241
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,440
Come on, I'll explain on the way.

242
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,641
And it might just blow your mind.

243
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:20,320
Tahira, This is Ryan, Graham and Yaz.

244
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:22,000
Hi.

245
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:25,040
Tahira is from Aleppo in 1380.

246
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,560
I've explained about the TARDIS

247
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:28,960
and the fact that you're
from 700 years in the future.

248
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:30,680
I'm really not ready for today.

249
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,880
No. Don't tell me that,
'cause you're wrong.

250
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,600
Well, I'm telling you, you are.

251
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,160
- Who's she arguing with?
- The TARDIS.

252
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,080
Because it's telling
me, quite defiantly,

253
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:42,520
that these two strands
of fur do not exist,

254
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,080
when they're right there!

255
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:47,800
Those creatures that we saw
aren't registered in its database.

256
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:50,560
They've never existed. Will never exist.

257
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,920
Except they must,

258
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,880
'cause if they don't
exist, if they can't exist,

259
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,440
where did they come from?

260
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:56,880
And how?

261
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:58,480
Tell me what happened to your mate.

262
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:02,080
Some guy was in his room...
don't know how he got in there...

263
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:04,680
and it was like his fingers
were detached from his hand,

264
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:06,160
connected to Tibo's ear,

265
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,000
and it was draining something from him.

266
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,360
What did he look like?

267
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,760
He was bald and... tattooed head.

268
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:14,080
Whoa. Same bloke that was in the flat.

269
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:15,400
And you.

270
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,080
The psychic incursion in your head.

271
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:19,000
Someone trying to communicate with you.

272
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:20,435
Yeah. But it was a woman.

273
00:17:20,436 --> 00:17:22,640
She was trapped inside this, um...

274
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,240
I don't know. I couldn't
make head nor tail of it.

275
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:27,600
But then I saw these... um...

276
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:29,120
... like, planets.

277
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:32,040
They were burning, like she
was connected to 'em somehow.

278
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,360
Someone's targeting us.

279
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,880
Do you have any idea where
those planets might be?

280
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,880
You get me an A to Z of the universe,

281
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,440
and I'll be able to stick
my finger straight...

282
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:43,160
Um, no. I've got no idea.

283
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:45,040
Right, then. Better idea.

284
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,121
TARDIS telepathic circuits.

285
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:49,880
- Doc...
- Stop fidgeting, will you?

286
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:50,920
Agh!

287
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:51,921
Doc...

288
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,440
Ow! I don't like it.
Are you sure it's safe?

289
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:54,760
You trust me, don't you?

290
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,681
- Have I got to answer that?
- Oi!

291
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:59,320
- Is it gonna hurt?
- No.

292
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:00,440
Probably not.

293
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,080
Maybe. Yeah.

294
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,520
- Ready?
- No!

295
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:05,321
- Focus on the image.
- Oh...

296
00:18:09,801 --> 00:18:11,280
Doc!

297
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:12,640
Ouch.

298
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,080
Aagh!

299
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,041
We found something. We're moving.

300
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:19,800
But where?

301
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:36,361
Deep space. Distant future.

302
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,241
Is this what you saw?

303
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:41,721
No. Nothing like this.

304
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,720
Then why here?

305
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:47,881
What did the telepathic
circuits lock onto?

306
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,640
If they were hooked into your mind,

307
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,440
no wonder we're
somewhere dark and weird.

308
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:53,840
Oi!

309
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,960
Do you even know where we are?

310
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:58,280
Half a galaxy past the Geskin Straits.

311
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,040
Very little out here.

312
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,040
No civilisations left by now.

313
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,040
It doesn't feel like a ship, though.

314
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:08,000
And we're in geostationary orbit,
and that would be deliberate.

315
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,600
So, why here?

316
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,760
Are we underground? Is
that why it's so dark?

317
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:16,160
The Doctor reckons we're in
a building, among the stars.

318
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,800
We've come a long way from home.

319
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:20,560
That's impossible. Nobody
can travel across the stars.

320
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,240
Unless you're the Doctor.

321
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,520
She's basically the
definition of impossible.

322
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,241
Oh! Control hub.

323
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,280
Operator-activated.

324
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:34,120
Oh. Now, you've got
something there, Doc.

325
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,680
Yeah. But what?

326
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:36,921
There... look.

327
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,880
That is exactly what I saw.

328
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,560
Those two objects.

329
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,000
This must be a monitor platform.

330
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:46,920
Observing events in this
part of the solar system.

331
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,120
What are they... like, planets?

332
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,000
Looks like they're
falling into each other.

333
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:53,640
Colliding. About to destroy each other.

334
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:56,000
It's an extinction event.

335
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:58,240
But... they're not colliding,
and they should be.

336
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:00,201
What's stopping the final collapse?

337
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,561
Let's take a little zoom in.

338
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:08,920
Whoa! There's something
there, between those planets.

339
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:10,401
What sort of something?

340
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,200
Good question.

341
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:17,243
Whoa! The engineering required

342
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:19,880
to create that and keep it in place...

343
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:23,840
Bravo. Whoever built that,
round of applause from me.

344
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:27,000
Doc, can... can you
magnify it? Like, zoom in?

345
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,521
- Why?
- Well, I think there's more to see.

346
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,760
A tiny geo orb locked in place.

347
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:35,481
Is there someone in there?

348
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:40,041
Are you here? Is it you?

349
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,200
Th... that's it.

350
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,601
She's trapped. That's...
that's what I saw!

351
00:20:46,841 --> 00:20:48,760
Doc, we... we gotta help her out.

352
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,081
Please.

353
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,760
Hey! Have you seen this?

354
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,641
This whole section
is covered in fingers.

355
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,801
What? Covered in fingers?

356
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,521
And there's a signal coming from them.

357
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:11,080
Broadcasting it to
that orb, to that girl.

358
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,680
Trapped.

359
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:15,440
A psychic signal fed by all this.

360
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,121
But what is it?

361
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:20,561
Ah!

362
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,521
This place has so many secrets to yield.

363
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:28,520
What do you reckon you've got there?

364
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,920
This tech is powering this platform,

365
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:33,760
powering that orb,

366
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:36,881
keeping it in place
between those two planets.

367
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:41,280
And at its heart, a
quantum fluctuation lock,

368
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:44,600
a sequence of changing combinations,

369
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:49,160
hundreds of billions of
combinations every millisecond,

370
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,081
which would mean that orb...

371
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,320
It's a prison, and
she's locked in there,

372
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:57,281
fed by that signal.

373
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,801
Signal of what, though?

374
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,241
Where's Tahira?

375
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:19,641
Maryam.

376
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,801
Do you recognise them?

377
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,320
The Chagaskas.

378
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:36,241
Your worst fears, my creativity.

379
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:40,401
There she is. Oi! Freakhands!
Get away from her!

380
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:44,240
Plus, you can release all
of these people right now.

381
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:47,001
And don't you ever come sneaking
back into my family's flat.

382
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:49,761
Oh, that's not good.

383
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,121
Do it right this time.

384
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:16,241
I won't be calling anyone.

385
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,480
No point.

386
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,520
You're weak.

387
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,361
You run.

388
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:27,001
Nobody's coming, Yaz.

389
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,921
You're alone in the dark.

390
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:46,721
Oh, no...

391
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:53,321
Sonya!

392
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:27,441
- Tibo?
- Where you been, man?

393
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,401
We waited for you.
You said you'd be back.

394
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,200
How long you been waiting?

395
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:36,161
Our whole lives.

396
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:39,640
What's with all the fire?

397
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:42,000
The place is burning.

398
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:44,961
- What place?
- Earth.

399
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,881
And you weren't here.

400
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,201
I thought we were mates.

401
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,881
Why am I hooked up to this?

402
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:25,880
Grace...

403
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:27,921
I'm sorry to tell you, Mr O'Brien...

404
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:30,840
... your cancer's returned.

405
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,600
Wh...

406
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,360
Well, no, no. No, that can't be right.

407
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:36,200
I've... I've had a check-up.

408
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,760
I, um...

409
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:39,480
Anyway, you're not my doctor.

410
00:25:39,481 --> 00:25:42,041
This time, it's very aggressive.

411
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:46,720
Well... how long have I got?

412
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,601
A couple of hours.

413
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:53,040
Why didn't you...

414
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,681
... save me?

415
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:58,600
I'm sorry.

416
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:00,401
Let me... let me try again.

417
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:07,360
Now, for most people, a
quantum flux lock is breakable.

418
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:10,841
100 billion combinations
every millisecond.

419
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:13,160
But I've got an app for that.

420
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:14,600
One sonic...

421
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:16,920
... connected to the
calculating power...

422
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:18,441
... of one TARDIS.

423
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:21,081
Shouldn't take too long, so...

424
00:26:22,241 --> 00:26:24,961
And I'm talking to myself again,
which means the others aren't here.

425
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:27,881
Hello, Doctor.

426
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:34,560
I've watched you...

427
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:36,921
... stumbling round this universe.

428
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:40,921
I presume this is all your doing.

429
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:46,520
Who's that girl in the orb?
And where are my friends?

430
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,281
Who are you?

431
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,001
I go by many names.

432
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:54,360
My preferred...

433
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,840
... my original...

434
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,801
... is Zellin.

435
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,081
No.

436
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:05,760
Zellin's a mythical name,

437
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:07,480
way beyond this universe.

438
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:10,200
Zellin was thought to be a god.

439
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,681
I blush.

440
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:15,240
It can't be.

441
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:18,960
We immortals need our games, Doctor.

442
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:23,681
Eternity is long and we
are cursed to see it all.

443
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,001
The Eternals have their games...

444
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:31,240
... the Guardians have
their power struggles.

445
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:38,560
For me, this dimension is a
beautiful board for a game.

446
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:40,960
The Toymaker would approve.

447
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:45,560
And I do like this
form... it's so... small.

448
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:50,441
To exist within molecules
and atoms is fascinating.

449
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:53,480
I can shape them,

450
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:55,480
regrow,

451
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:59,000
mould my form,

452
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:02,120
to provoke fear from humans

453
00:28:02,121 --> 00:28:06,761
as I extract nightmares from
the scared and vulnerable.

454
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,200
Now, that...

455
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:12,121
- ... is a good game.
- Wait.

456
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:16,720
Are you transmitting nightmares?

457
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:21,322
Taking nightmares from humans
and forcing them into the mind

458
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:23,403
of a girl you've
trapped between planets?

459
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,280
I've seen many races, Doctor,

460
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:29,561
and the humans are
infinitely fascinating.

461
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:32,120
Infinitely...

462
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:33,801
... pathetic.

463
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,401
But, of course, you know that.

464
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:39,920
We share the same obsession.

465
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:41,840
We're not the same.

466
00:28:41,841 --> 00:28:42,961
No.

467
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:46,361
You are so much lesser.

468
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,521
You know the best part of humanity?

469
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,801
The thing that truly sets them apart?

470
00:28:56,161 --> 00:29:01,321
The cruelty of their own minds
directed towards themselves.

471
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,561
The doubt. The fear.

472
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:09,800
The endless voices telling themselves

473
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:12,480
they're incapable and unworthy.

474
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:13,641
Hmm!

475
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,681
Such an exquisite animal.

476
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,480
Built-in pain.

477
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:24,120
And the repositories of that pain?

478
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:25,840
The nightmares.

479
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:31,680
I presume that's your doing, Doctor.

480
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,160
Always interfering.

481
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:36,000
I've watched you blunder into this.

482
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,880
"Blundering"... top of my CV,

483
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:39,560
alongside "Plays well with others"

484
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,880
and "Excellent tap-dancer in a crisis".

485
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,521
Almost clever.

486
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,601
But not quite clever enough.

487
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:49,240
You sure about that?

488
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:52,401
'Cause, look... your
prisoner, she's free.

489
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:56,601
I used your own technology against you.

490
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,600
No, Doctor.

491
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:03,320
I used your instincts against you.

492
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:04,521
What?

493
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:11,520
I made the Chagaskas, targeted
the humans, to entice you here.

494
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:15,920
I needed someone from this realm
to break a lock from this realm.

495
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:17,601
Only one would do.

496
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:19,961
You.

497
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:22,761
No.

498
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:27,520
You did find the right answer,

499
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:30,321
but you weren't asking
the right question, so...

500
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:34,081
My freedom.

501
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:40,160
This platform isn't my technology.

502
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:42,040
I didn't make this prison.

503
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:45,200
She was always the more powerful of us.

504
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:47,520
The more dangerous.

505
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:49,321
That's why they imprisoned her.

506
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:52,520
I just...

507
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:54,881
... ride in her slipstream.

508
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:03,640
Release?

509
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:05,401
After all this time?

510
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,720
I don't understand.

511
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:11,161
Let me make you.

512
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:18,400
Two creatures from another
realm descended into a universe

513
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,481
where they were worshipped as gods.

514
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:25,280
They saw two planets and laid a wager...

515
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:28,321
which of them could bring a
planet to destruction first?

516
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,800
The gods set to their game,

517
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:33,520
sowing chaos through the populations.

518
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:36,960
Wars began, between species,

519
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,961
then between the planets themselves.

520
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:42,480
The gods delighted in the carnage.

521
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:43,961
It passed the time.

522
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:48,720
But slowly, the inhabitants
of the worlds grew wise,

523
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:51,600
realised what these
creatures had done to them.

524
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:55,520
They unified, and fought back
against their so-called gods.

525
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:59,080
They set their own planets
into a collision course

526
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:02,720
and at the heart of the
collision they laid a prison.

527
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:07,281
They trapped one creature
between the planets for eternity.

528
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:11,120
The other fled, vowing to return

529
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:13,241
to release his eternal partner.

530
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:16,760
Wake up, Doctor.

531
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:18,720
Welcome back.

532
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:20,641
I hope you understand now.

533
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:25,560
I wasn't torturing her with nightmares.

534
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:30,000
I was feeding her what
she needed to stay sane...

535
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:33,440
the pain of others.

536
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:36,880
But even gods need a
helping hand, Doctor.

537
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:38,681
Thank you.

538
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:44,161
You won't feel a thing
when this all burns.

539
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,120
Yes, they will.

540
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,401
Yes.

541
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,681
Where now?

542
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:58,040
All those nightmares... I loved them.

543
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,800
Humans?

544
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:01,361
Earth.

545
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,160
Let's take them all.

546
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:06,081
Yes.

547
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,001
Oh, come on.

548
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:51,560
What do you think it
feels like for them...

549
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:57,520
to be such... tiny, ephemeral
flashes of existence?

550
00:33:57,521 --> 00:33:59,001
Hmm.

551
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:05,801
They feel so much.

552
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,000
It must burn them.

553
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:10,921
I think it does.

554
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:22,240
It's buried deep in all our memories.

555
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:24,960
In our identity.

556
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:28,600
Built on the lie of the Timeless Child.

557
00:34:35,681 --> 00:34:38,681
Mm! Right. Think
this'll hold me, do you?

558
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:49,800
Oh!

559
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,200
Ugh!

560
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:52,601
Disgusting.

561
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,201
Oh!

562
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,081
Oh!

563
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:02,120
Oh!

564
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:04,480
I have just had the maddest dream.

565
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:06,040
I know. You all have.

566
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,520
Tranquillising psycho-extraction.

567
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:08,880
I need to get Tibo.

568
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,720
We have to get everybody safe
and back to their rightful place.

569
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,520
Well, maybe if you stop messing
around with those finger things.

570
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:18,281
Tapped into the bio-organic
code. Sonic does fingers.

571
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:24,361
Down.

572
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,680
Stay.

573
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:31,200
Good dog.

574
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:33,320
- Ew.
- Could be useful.

575
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:35,920
Ryan... where am I?

576
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:37,640
Alright, mate, try
not to freak out, yeah?

577
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,560
But you're on a floating space platform

578
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:42,080
in a gravitational pull
between two colliding planets

579
00:35:42,081 --> 00:35:43,520
halfway across the universe

580
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:45,680
'cause of the guy who was
stealing your nightmares

581
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:47,201
through creepy detachable fingers.

582
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:49,800
Prank?

583
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:52,000
No.

584
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:54,120
Take me through that again.

585
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,280
What are they?

586
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,361
I know why they didn't attack you.

587
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:01,760
Because they're yours.

588
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:06,680
Zellin, that man, created the
Chagaska from your nightmares.

589
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:10,121
They wouldn't kill you. They
couldn't, because you created them.

590
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:16,880
So, how do you defeat
two rampaging immortals?

591
00:36:16,881 --> 00:36:18,840
Answer... you don't.

592
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,320
Those two planets,

593
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:23,320
they've spent a millennia
trying to work out how to do it.

594
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:25,800
Well, I think the motivational
speech needs a bit of work, Doc,

595
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:27,840
if you don't m... and,
also, a plan, by the way.

596
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,120
I've got plans crashing
through my brain all the time.

597
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:32,560
You want a plan? Come to me.

598
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:35,961
Identifying which plan's gonna
work... that's the tricky bit.

599
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:47,800
This is perfect, Zellin.

600
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:49,520
You've done well.

601
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:51,160
Take them all.

602
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:52,800
Mm.

603
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,041
Billions in one go.

604
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,920
Gorge on their fears.

605
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,441
Why would we rush?

606
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,241
We have so much time...

607
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:07,321
... to walk in their nightmares.

608
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:12,441
We can pass eternity here...

609
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,241
... if we take it slow.

610
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,401
Of course.

611
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:28,640
I've told you... there are no bogeymen.

612
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:30,840
Nothing to be worried about.

613
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,481
Night-night.

614
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,601
That's not true.

615
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:17,720
What was that?

616
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:20,960
I manifested a creature
from a human nightmare.

617
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:23,360
It's calling across the timewaves.

618
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:25,161
A pet?

619
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:30,641
I want to see.

620
00:38:40,081 --> 00:38:41,800
Oh, nice entrance.

621
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:45,680
Welcome to Aleppo. Very beautiful city.

622
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:47,840
How are you here?

623
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:50,880
I'm that little bit smarter
than you thought I was.

624
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:54,241
Now, listen to me. Earth
is not your plaything.

625
00:38:56,481 --> 00:38:58,200
You're wrong about humans.

626
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:01,760
They're not pathetic.
They're magnificent.

627
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:05,280
They live with their
fears, doubts, guilts.

628
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:08,961
They face them down every
day and they prevail.

629
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,521
That's not weakness. That's strength.

630
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,720
That's what humanity is.

631
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:17,680
- Isn't that right, Tahira?
- Yes, Doctor.

632
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:20,320
Why don't you show
them how strong you are?

633
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:22,841
My Chagaska.

634
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:26,481
How can you control it?

635
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:31,280
Literally conquered her fear.

636
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,161
Are you confronting us?

637
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,040
Yeah.

638
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,320
You immortals.

639
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:41,120
So entitled. So spoilt.

640
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:42,640
You never clear up after yourself.

641
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,041
And you should be really careful
what you leave lying around.

642
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:48,601
Oh! Sorry. I won't do that again.

643
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,601
Just returning your lost property.

644
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:56,320
Thanks for lending a helping hand.

645
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:57,881
- Really?
- I couldn't resist.

646
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:00,801
What's your worst nightmare?

647
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:04,840
Now, Tahira!

648
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,200
You made my nightmares
real, now you can live with them...

649
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:15,824
for all eternity.

650
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:18,393
Yes! Gods back in their box.

651
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:20,417
We need to get this back
to the monitor platform...

652
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,281
... and all those people
out of the TARDIS jacuzzi.

653
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:23,282
Come on.

654
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:36,721
Slept like a baby last night.

655
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,480
Good, 'cause you need all
the beauty sleep you can get.

656
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,680
- Oi. Man's still looking fresh.
- Ooh.

657
00:40:47,641 --> 00:40:49,161
Well, you'll be going again.

658
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:51,840
Yeah.

659
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:54,600
But you could've told me
the truth about it all.

660
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:56,120
Would you have believed me?

661
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,600
Nope.

662
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:00,841
It's a bit more than just
the world you're seeing.

663
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,321
- Do you know when you'll be back?
- Not sure.

664
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:11,201
Well, don't make it too long.

665
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:15,561
I need my best mate.

666
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:21,721
I get a bit lost without him.

667
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:25,521
Yeah, I get that too.

668
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:32,320
Look, I've been looking at
something that might help,

669
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:33,760
for me mate.

670
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:37,321
And there's something I need you
to do for me, and you can't argue.

671
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:43,761
I get down and I shut myself off.

672
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:46,921
And it's like I'm paralysed with it.

673
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,720
For days.

674
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:51,241
Weeks.

675
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:53,921
It's in control of me.

676
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:58,321
And I thought I'd try
and do something about it.

677
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:01,720
I went to the supermarket, just
so I could talk to the cashier...

678
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:04,320
you know, get back to human contact.

679
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,440
But I got there

680
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,000
and it's those self-service checkouts.

681
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:14,801
I haven't said that to anyone before.

682
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:18,440
I felt like it was just me.

683
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:20,361
It's not just you.

684
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,820
_

685
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,840
Hitchhiking?

686
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:50,600
No.

687
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,720
Just taking in the view?

688
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:55,521
- Not breaking the law, am I?
- No.

689
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:58,361
Where you off to?

690
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:01,680
Away.

691
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:03,320
It's good there.

692
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:05,560
- Leave me alone.
- Can't do that.

693
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:07,360
Why not?

694
00:43:07,361 --> 00:43:09,720
- People are worried about you.
- No, they're not.

695
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,840
Your sister is.

696
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:13,481
That's why she called us.

697
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:18,321
She's worried you've left and
you're gonna do something stupid.

698
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:22,960
I've heard things are tough.

699
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,960
Getting bullied at school.

700
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:26,841
Grades have gone a bit wonky.

701
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:30,201
Parents don't get what's up.

702
00:43:33,841 --> 00:43:36,321
You must be feeling
pretty trapped and alone.

703
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:39,641
I'm feeling way more than that.

704
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:44,200
That's better than the other way.

705
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:45,760
What?

706
00:43:45,761 --> 00:43:48,360
Well, feeling things isn't wrong.

707
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:50,881
- I don't want your speech.
- I know.

708
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:54,521
Terrible thing about being older...

709
00:43:55,721 --> 00:44:00,801
... is you have all this experience
and nobody ever wants to hear it.

710
00:44:02,801 --> 00:44:06,201
'Cause I know that there's
so much ahead of you.

711
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,401
What if this moment...

712
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:15,560
... where you want to run... away
from everyone, including yourself...

713
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:17,040
is just that?

714
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,721
A moment.

715
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:24,201
What if we find a way to get you
through it and out the other side?

716
00:44:30,641 --> 00:44:32,121
I've been where you are.

717
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:35,521
Moments change.

718
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:41,800
Help's out there, as much
or as little as you need.

719
00:44:41,801 --> 00:44:43,321
I'm not listening to you.

720
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:47,761
Would hard cash make a difference?

721
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:50,521
I'll make you a deal.

722
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:54,920
Look me up in three years. If
I'm wrong, I'll give you 50 quid.

723
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:57,200
I mean, I'd say more,
but the pay's rubbish.

724
00:44:57,201 --> 00:45:00,721
- Get another job, then.
- Can't. Love it too much.

725
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:04,848
But if I'm right...

726
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:07,681
... you owe me 50p.

727
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:10,800
Come on.

728
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,561
Those are good odds.

729
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:36,521
Hi. Can I help you?

730
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:39,727
Hi. You won't remember me.

731
00:45:39,728 --> 00:45:41,360
- My name's Yasm...
- Yasmin Khan.

732
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:43,481
I flippin' do remember you.

733
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:50,561
I've got something for you.

734
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:00,601
You want to come in?

735
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:08,520
The thing is, Doc, I worry about
getting sick again, you know?

736
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:11,760
About the... about
the cancer coming back.

737
00:46:11,761 --> 00:46:15,201
And I didn't know who to say it
to, so I thought I'd say it to you.

738
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:18,361
You know, seeing as you're a doctor.

739
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,720
Look, 'cause once...

740
00:46:20,721 --> 00:46:23,760
... once you have it, it's
with you the whole time.

741
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,680
Not... not quite a shadow, but, uh...

742
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:29,080
Hey, don't get me wrong... I mean,
my check-ups, they're all fine.

743
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,761
But it... it made me think.

744
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:33,680
You know? And, uh...

745
00:46:33,681 --> 00:46:35,961
... I thought I should talk about it.

746
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:38,961
'Cause those nightmares... I mean...

747
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,880
Well, they made me realise

748
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:45,601
that the fear is...
is still there. Yeah.

749
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:54,521
I should say a reassuring
thing now, shouldn't I?

750
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:57,920
Yeah, probably.

751
00:46:57,921 --> 00:47:00,041
I'm still quite socially awkward.

752
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:04,760
So, I'm just gonna subtly
walk towards the console

753
00:47:04,761 --> 00:47:06,440
and look at something.

754
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:08,801
And then... in a minute...

755
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,441
... I'll think of something
that I should've said...

756
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:15,920
... that might have been helpful.

757
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:17,960
Okay.

758
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,360
Well...

759
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:22,280
I'm glad we had this chat, eh?

760
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:23,721
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

761
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,081
How long is this gonna last, Yaz?

762
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:30,240
Hanging out with the Doctor.

763
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:32,720
I don't know.

764
00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:34,400
Is this our lives?

765
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:37,681
Going from one place to
the next, ignoring home?

766
00:47:39,001 --> 00:47:40,881
We're getting older but without them.

767
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:44,440
Missing out bits of their lives.

768
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:45,920
When we're done,

769
00:47:45,921 --> 00:47:48,280
the Doctor can drop you off at
whatever point you want, though.

770
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:50,480
Yeah, but we'll have
changed. They wouldn't have.

771
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:53,280
It's like we're living
at different rates.

772
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:55,241
The Doctor said we
won't come back the same.

773
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:00,440
I was thinking... Frankenstein.

774
00:48:00,441 --> 00:48:01,720
- What?
- Did I interrupt?

775
00:48:01,721 --> 00:48:02,800
Am I interrupting?

776
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:04,800
- No.
- Cool.

777
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,801
You might need to change your clothes.

778
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:10,000
On we go.

779
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:11,600
On we go.

780
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:12,921
Right.

782
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:58,000
How about writing the most gruesome,

783
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,240
spine-chilling ghost story of all time?

784
00:49:03,242 --> 00:49:05,521
Tales of the Dead.
